# Website Name

This is a website that I have developed which incorporates a fully functional English calendar. Users can add and delete events, as well as add new events for a specific day by selecting it from the calendar. All user events will be stored in the local storage.

## Features

1. Calendar: The website features a well-designed and user-friendly calendar that allows users to view events for specific dates.

2. Event Management: Users can easily add and delete events. The website provides a simple interface for adding event details such as title, description, date, and time.

3. Day Selection: By selecting a specific date from the calendar, users can add new events for that day. This feature makes it convenient for users to manage their events on a day-to-day basis.

4. Local Storage: All user events are stored in the local storage, ensuring that data is saved even when the website is closed or refreshed. This feature enables users to access their events anytime they visit the website.
